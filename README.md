# Assignment for Students :eyeglasses:

Build a simple php-Application that gets data from the DB (sample file is in this repo) and displays it.
Finished app must contain:
  1. start page where the articles are listed
  2. separated/single article pages 
Every article on the startpage must be clickable and lead to the separated/single article page.

## Requirements
- all code must be beautified (nice to have: linted), there are many extensions for VS Code, PHPStorm has it out of
  the box
- application must have a clear folder structure
- design is up to you but it has to be readable and accessible (pages for inspiration: dribbble and/or pinterest)
- any transition/animation effects are up to you
- you can add any functional feature to the app (but it is not obligatory)
- you can use any css preprocessor and any task runner (but it is not obligatory)
- attach the screenshot of Chrome Lighthouse analysis to the application (example is in this repo). All the params (perfomance, accessibility, best practices and seo) must show at least 85 points
- please provide a link to the GitHub/GitLab repo and not(!) zipped folder
